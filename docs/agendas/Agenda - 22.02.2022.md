Date:           {February 22nd 2022}\
Main focus:     {Finishing up preparations}\
Chair:          {Jesse Vleeschdraager}\
Note taker:     {Violeta-Mara Macsim}

# Opening

*Check that everybody is present, and once that's the case do the stand-up meeting (everyone gives a short update on
their activities of the previous week).*

# Approval of the agenda

*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action

- Distribute the tasks for the upcoming week
- Discuss the following with the TA:
    - Code of Conduct feedback
    - Backlog feedback
    - API endpoints
    - Good GitLab practices

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)

*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should
implement.*

# Any other business

*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2),
he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA

*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask
them then.*

- For the feedback for the HCI assignment, do we need to cooperate with one group or can we individually ask students
  from different groups?

# Question round

*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Session notes

- *Write these during the session*

# Closing

*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*

# Notes

1. Code of conduct feedback:

- short assignment description
- add some goals except for the grade
- correct mention for “GitHub”
- concrete standards
- add how we set the deadlines
- make a person responsible for deliverables - a fixed person
- elaborate the values of behavior and how we resolve discussions
- add goals and preparations of meetings
- mention that everyone should adhere to the decisions

2. Issues feedback:

- missing basic parts of a game (ex.: connecting to a game)


3. API endpoints:

- at least one working endpoint by end of the week (ex.: GET, POST, DELETE, etc.)

4. Good GitLab practices:

- one feature per issue
- independent and small tasks per issue
- one issue should be done by a person in a week
- edit one of the issue’s labels
- the description should be longer and should be clearer and should include a detailed definition of when it should be
  done (can use Markdown to make checkboxes); suggested solutions; type of issue (feature or bug fix)
- Gitlab issue board to keep track of everything
- time estimation of each task
- review merge request ( just comment it)
- to review just pull the commit and test it
- everyone should review - comment on everything
- document everything in GitLab even if it is spoken verbally in meetings
- every pipeline should be green, otherwise, the next commit should fix that

5. Merge from the branch to Development and then to Main for every commit per person.

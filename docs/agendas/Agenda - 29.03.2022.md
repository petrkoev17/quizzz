# Opening

*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda

*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action

## Progress check

- What is there left to do to make the multiplayer functional?
- Are there any bugs that we need to fix?
- What issues are left from the last sprint?

## Planning

- We should be done with all the basic multiplayer features this week
- Sprint 7 will be reserved for bug fixing
    - Discuss if anyone has encountered any bugs. Make issues to fix them this sprint or the next one
- Have the presentation done by Wednesday, so we can check and review it before the deadline.

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)

*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should
implement.*

# Any other business

*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2),
he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA

- What do we have to do for the presentation and how do we prepare?
- Do we have to prepare a video or a live presentation?
- What features of the game should we emphasize in the presentation?
- Should we limit our presentation to the feature themselves, or do we have to also explain the implementation process
  and our weekly planning?
- Are we allowed to use WebSockets?
- Ask about the flags we've received last week just to make sure everything is fine now.

# Tips / tops round

*Here everyone gives a tip and a top to another group member or the group as a whole.*

# Question round

*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing

- Next week

In italics, you will find some additional explanations of the agenda points. You will find mostly the same points in the
next agendas.

# Opening

*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda

*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action

## Progress check:

- How close are we to achieving the minimum expectation from the course?
- Does anyone have any remaining issues from previous sprints?

## Planning

- Currently, there are 19 solved issues
- There are still 6 "MUST HAVE" issues from previous weeks
- Set stricter deadlines for each sprint
- Everyone should have their issue(s) merged into Development at the end of the week

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)

*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should
implement.*

# Any other business

*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2),
he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA

- Will we receive the GitInspector data after every week?

# Question round

*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing

- Don't forget about this week's deadlines to submit the issues
  *Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*

# Notes

### Progress Check

* 3 issues remaining from sprint 3; one just needs to be merged, one almost done (only testing remains) and one
  depending on the one that just needs to be tested.
* 12 must haves remaining.

### Planning

* Stick to 1 merge request before Sunday, merge into main if everyone has finished at least 1 issue.
* Don’t try to cover up someone else’s unfinished issue, that’s their problem.
* Make sure to estimate times of issues.
* Don’t worry too much about the amount of issues left.

### Deadlines

* Sprint 4

### Tips

* Communicate more about ideas (idea input not evenly distributed).
* Be a bit more involved in the process of planning.
* Stick more to the deadlines of the sprints.
* Do merge requests faster.
* Keep up the standards of distributing work.
* Rotate who creates the sprint and add issues to it, mark merge request as draft when you have to fix something, so
  it’s clear if it can be approved or not.

### Tops

* Good progress on the work load.
* Better communication in last 1-2 weeks.
* Handled the Friday meeting’s issue well.
* Better communication than at the start.
* Better distribution after Friday (actually dividing the work instead of just taking issues personally).
* Handled Friday’s situation well, did more in the previous couple days, more organized issue list.

### Other

* We can decide on our own implementation for storing the images.
* For the presentation: Most likely we have to make a video explaining all features, and then further explain the video
  during the presentation. We will also get an official announcement about this later.

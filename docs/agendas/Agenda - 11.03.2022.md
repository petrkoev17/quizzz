## Tips / tops round

- Remember the CPR model:
    - Content
    - Process
    - Relationship
- Remember how to give feedback
    - Observation of behavior
    - Consequence and feeling
    - Desired situation or behavior
- Remember how to receive feedback
    - Understand
    - Thank the other person
    - Assess

1. One of the team members says something about each item of the CPR model in general and gives personal feedback (if
   needed)
2. The next person summarizes what the previous person said in the general part
3. If the previous person doesn't agree, he/she can correct the other person
4. Then the person that summarized goes on with step 1
5. Finally, the first person summarizes what the last person said in the general part

implement.*

# Any other business

*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2),
he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

- Is this meeting the teamwork assignment 4B?

# Question round

*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Notes

Tips/tops round

- Kees - Frontend looks nice, code reviews are going very good, there are clear comments, tip – if issues appear on
  backend ask for help.
- Jesse about Violeta - Don’t overwork yourself. You are doing very good.
- Violeta about Adelina - She is doing good, tip – communicate a bit more and don't be so shy.
- Adelina about Petar - You have good ideas, tip - talk more in person meetings.
- Petar about Kees - You have good contribution and previous knowledge, tip - take more leadership in meetings.
- Kees about Žygimantas - The scene builder looks good, it follows what we discussed, tip - in meetings if you have
  ideas just tell them.
- Zyg about Petar front end good, timer good, tip – be more active in live meetings

Communication issues:

* During meetings discuss what we have and then leave the meeting. Don't stay in it doing nothing.

Reviewing:

* It is not good that Kees reviews everything.
* Tip – assign 2 people for reviewing. It could be the same people every time.
* When you assign someone send it in chat.
* Everyone else except Kees should spend more time for reviewing.
* Jesse, Petar and Adelina should spend more time on reviewing the following week.

Code of conduct:

* Change code of conduct goals
* Make it more concrete in dealing with conflicts
* Try to keep meetings as targeted as possible

Planning:

* Sprint 3 – not planned yet. Not the best idea because we are lagging behind with the sprint. Sprints should be strict
  deadlines. If we have issues that aren’t done from previous sprints, move them to the new one.
* Sprint 3 – should end on Tuesday before team meeting.
* In each week we need 1 merge request for the code requirement.
* Don’t steal issues. Update Adelina's merge request and remove Violeta’s part that covers the waiting room. Make sure
  that we review all the merge requests that are up now and finish up.
* Issues are assigned but not started. Finish things that are assigned now. Next planning session will be on Tuesday.
  Adapt to the current status of the team.
* Git inspector reports.
* Lagging behind compared to others. After Tuesday take up more issues.

Deadlines:

* Submitting documents – we shouldn’t have one person assigned to submitting documents
* The person who is handling the sprint should also be in charge of the submission of documents
* 2 people could plan the sprint for the next week
* Follow sprints!

# Closing

- Keep in mind the deadlines for today:
    - Buddycheck
    - Teamwork 4B
- Next week
    - Chair: Violeta
    - Note taker: Jesse

*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*

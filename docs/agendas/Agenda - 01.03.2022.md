## Example agenda

This is a template agenda. It gives an overview of what could be in your weekly agenda. In the 'Points of action' part
you will also find some topics to cover in/after your first meeting.

---

Date:           {01.03.2022}\
Main focus:     {Progress Check}\
Chair:          {Petar Koev}\
Note taker:     {Kees Blok}

In italics, you will find some additional explanations of the agenda points. You will find mostly the same points in the
next agendas.

# Opening

*Here you check that everybody is present.*\
Everyone gives a small summary of the activities in which they participated the previous week.

# Approval of the agenda

*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action

*The items below are things you should look into after the meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of)
the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*

* Distribute issues for the following week.

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)

*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should
implement.*

# Any other business

*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2),
he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA

*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask
them then.*

* What was Sebastian talking about when he said that it is a problem if we parse json into string because that is what
  json parsers do. If we aren't supposed to do that what should we do instead?
* Is it sufficient to write tests for the controller in the manner shown in QueoteControllerTest or if we should do
  integration tests with mock API?

# Question round

*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing

*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*

# Notes

### Distributing work

* Everyone told what he/she is going to do this week. For the details about this, see the issues on GitLab.

### Feedback HCI report

* Put the url of Figma into the document if it isn't there yet.
* State the topics that were covered in the review or give the reviews in bit more raw format. Look in the rubric / ask
  in the HCI channel on Mattermost how to do this exactly.
* Prioritization is needed for the issues that came up in the reviews, for example put them in a frequency / impact
  table.
* Relate the fixes / issues to the heuristics of Nielsen.

### Merge requests

* Create one merge request every week.
* Not mandatory to actually merge it because if there are comments, then they are there to improve the overall code
  quality.

### Buddy check

* Really mandatory, so fill it in.
* Fill it in seriously.
* This is the time to raise concerns.
* Everything is anonymous, so really write down each and every concern, this is the time!
* Keep in mind that you can always notify the TA/course staff/academic counsellor if you encounter even a problem /
  concern. Do this as soon as possible even if it's just a small concern, because this may help you later on in the
  project and prevent (bigger) issues later on.

### Deadlines

* Agenda (every week)
* Notes (every week)
* Activity bank (04-03-2022)
* Buddy check (11-03-2022)

### Some questions that were asked

* For the controllers of the API endpoints, do we need to use Mock API?
    * You only need to do unit tests.
    * Other kinds of tests are allowed, you just don't gain a lot of extra points.
    * The knowledge you gained from OOP should be enough.
    * If you can test it, test it. If the code is not tested, see it as if there were no code at all.


* In the lectures they said to not parse JSON, but what to do with the activities?
    * Try to use as much automation of Spring as possible.


* The titles of the activities are not standardized, how should we use them?
    * Use them as they are, you won't get punished for a different format if they don't give you a format.


* Are the reviews also sources for the HCI report?
    * At least you need 1/2 more sources.
    * See the rubric for specific information.


* When do sprints start & end?
    * The sprint can start at whatever day you like, but try to merge into main before Sunday evening.


* Can we carry over ongoing issues to the next sprint?
    * Yes, but make sure to document it.
